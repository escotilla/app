      <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
      <h2>CONTEXT – THE NEED FOR RESPONSIBLE MICRO DOLLAR CREDIT</h2>
      <p>If you are a small business owner in a developing country with little-or-no credit history, one of the
        so-called
        “frontier credits,” your options are limited if you need to borrow money to build your business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, most mainstream financial institutions haven’t figured out how to evaluate the risk profile or
        likelihood of repayment of someone who falls into this category – or how to make serving such a population
        profitable enough to warrant the effort.

      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes the only option available to individuals with limited credit history is to turn to loan sharks in the
        black market. Some of these alternatives may have high rates or unrealistic payment terms, and are often
        enforced
        through intimidation or other illegal and unethical means. Because many of these alternatives do not report
        data,
        these loans do not necessarily help individuals establish the credit history they need.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some of these circumstances, as little as $25 can enable a borrower to start or grow a business, and help he
        or
        she to realize his or her full potential. For some, it’s a matter of survival, for others it’s the fuel for a
        life-long ambition.

        OUR MANTRA – OPENING THE HATCH
      </h2>
      <p>
        When an Escotilla loan enables someone to grow a business and create opportunity for themselves, it creates
        opportunities for others as well. That ripple effect can shape the future for a family or an entire community.

      <h2>THE COMPANY</h2>
      <p>
        Escotilla Financiera is a financial technology company with the mission of providing affordable micro business
        loans to entrepreneurs in Latin America.
        Escotilla requires Borrowers to demonstrate business financial literacy as part of the application before they
        are
        allowed to take out loans. We offer bilingual (English/Spanish) servicing and documentation via Web or mobile.
      </p>
      <h2>
        ESCOTILLA’S APPROACH TO LENDING
      </h2>
      <p>
        We charge fees and interest to cover our costs and allow us to continue our mission of providing affordable,
        reliable micro credit to entrepreneurs. Our repayment recovery methods include reminders, mediation involving
        the
        local community leaders and other contacts on social media, and judicial process. We will never engage in
        harassment, abusive language, threats, or seizure of property without court order. We will also not deprive
        entrepreneurs of their basic means of livelihood in order to repay a loan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Escotilla micro business loans range from $1 to $200*.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Escotilla loans are responsible: Our proprietary underwriting determines every loan applicant’s ability to
          repay and approves loans to those it calculates are likely to repay on time. Our underwriting also includes
          checking against international sanctions and enforcements for all loan applicants.
        </li>
        <li>Payment terms are realistic: Our loans feature fixed, affordable payments over 3 to 12 months. There are no
          “surprise” balloon payments. There is no penalty for pre-payment. Payment frequencies align to the borrowers
          pay
          periods or other needs.
        </li>
        <li>Our loans are affordable: Compared to the alternatives typically available to people with limited credit
          history — including loan sharks and black market loans — Escotilla loans are affordable. Those alternatives
          are
          not only far more expensive than Escotilla loans, but can be unreliable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        *Loans will be disbursed up to $100 initially, with the remaining balance disbursed after 2 successful repayment
        periods.
